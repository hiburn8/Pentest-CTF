  </ul>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>If you discover an unintentional method of completing a lab, please report this to the lab's author. At their discretion you may be able to keep the flag/points and/or be credited with reward points.</li>
<li>If a lab requires you to add or modify files on a host, please clean up after completing it.</li>
<li>Don't be a dick.</li>
